                        <h2>1. The Services We Provide</h2>
                            <p>Our mission is to empower people to build communities and bring the world closer together through meaningful connections. To help achieve this, we offer the following products and services:</p>
                            <br>
                        <h4>Connect with people and communities you care about</h4>
                            <p>We help you discover and connect with friends, groups, businesses, and organizations you care about across our platform. Using data, we suggest relevant connections, such as people you might want to chat with, groups to join, events to attend, and more. Stronger connections make for better communities, and we believe our services are most valuable when you can engage with those who matter to you.</p>
                        <h4>Express yourself and communicate easily</h4>
                            <p>Our app offers various ways to communicate with your friends and community. Whether you're chatting one-on-one or in a group, we make it easy for you to express yourself and stay in touch with what matters most to you.</p>
                        <h4>Discover relevant content, products, and services</h4>
                            <p>We provide personalized recommendations, including ads and sponsored content, to help you discover products, services, and other content that interests you. These suggestions come from businesses and organizations that use our platform to reach users like you.</p>
                        <h4>Ensure safety, security, and integrity</h4>
                            <p>Your safety and security are our top priorities. We use advanced systems to detect and address harmful content or behavior, ensuring that our platform remains a safe space for everyone. If we identify misuse or harmful conduct, we may take actions like removing content, restricting features, or disabling accounts to maintain the integrity of our service.</p>
                        <h4>Research and improve our services</h4>
                            <p>We engage in research to improve our app by analyzing user behavior and feedback. This includes testing new features, troubleshooting issues, and learning more about how our users engage with the app to make it even better.</p>
                        <h4>Consistent and seamless experiences across platforms</h4>
                            <p>We design our app to provide a seamless experience across all our services. Whether you're chatting on one platform or browsing content on another, we make sure your experience is consistent and easy.</p>

                        <h2>2. How Our Services Are Funded</h2>
                            <p>Our chatting app is free to use, but we show personalized ads and sponsored content to help fund our services. By using our app, you agree that we can display ads tailored to your interests. We use your activity data, like the topics you engage with and your preferences, to show you ads and content that may be more relevant to you.</p>
                        <h4>Protecting Your Privacy</h4>
                            <p>Your privacy is important to us. Our ad system is designed to show you relevant ads without sharing your personal information with advertisers. We don’t sell your data. Instead, advertisers can tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, people aged 18-35 who enjoy sports), and we target their ads to users we believe might be interested.</p>
                        <h4>How We Share Information with Advertisers</h4>
                            <p>We provide advertisers with general performance data to help them understand how users engage with their ads, but we don’t share personal details that could identify you (like your name or email address) unless you explicitly give us permission. For example, we might inform advertisers that their ad was seen by users aged 25-34 who are interested in fitness, but we won’t disclose any identifying information about you.</p>

                                        <li>You do not have the right to share or that infringes on someone else’s rights (like intellectual property rights).</li>

                        <h4>The Permissions You Give Us</h4>
                            <p>To provide and improve our services, we need certain permissions from you:</p>

                                    You retain ownership of any content you share, such as photos or videos. However, by sharing content on our app, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license to use, distribute, modify, and display your content to provide and improve our services. This license ends when you delete the content from the app. You can delete your content at any time, and we will remove it from our systems, although it may take up to 90 days

                                <li>

                            <h4>4.1 Updating Our Terms</h4>
                                <p>We are constantly working to improve our services and add new features to enhance your experience. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our services, ensure a safe and secure experience, and comply with legal requirements. We will only make changes if the existing provisions are no longer appropriate, incomplete, or need adjustments for safety, security, or legal compliance.</p>
                                <p>We will notify you (e.g., by email or through the app) at least 30 days before we make any updates, giving you time to review the changes before they take effect, unless the changes are required by law. Once the updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our app.</p>
                                <p>If you do not agree to the updated Terms and no longer wish to use our app, you can delete your account at any time.</p>
                            
                            <h4>4.2 Account Suspension or Termination</h4>
                                <p>Our goal is to make the app a welcoming and safe space for all users. If we determine that you have seriously or repeatedly violated our Terms or policies, we may suspend or permanently disable your access to the app and delete your account. We may also take action if you repeatedly infringe on others' intellectual property rights or if required by law.</p>
                                <p>We may disable or delete your account if it remains inactive for an extended period, if we detect unauthorized use, or if your account is not confirmed after registration.</p>
                                <p>If we suspend or disable your account, we will notify you and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so would expose us or others to legal risks, harm our community, interfere with the integrity of our services, or is prohibited by law.</p>
                                <p>If your account is deleted or disabled, the Terms will terminate, but certain provisions will remain in effect.</p>
    
                            <h4>4.3 Limits on Liability </h4>
                                <p>We strive to provide the best service possible, but our app is provided "as is," and we make no guarantees regarding its safety, security, or error-free performance. We are not responsible for any actions or content shared by users, including any offensive, unlawful, or inappropriate content.</p>
                                <p>To the fullest extent allowed by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We are not liable for any lost profits, data, or other damages, even if we were warned of the possibility of such damages.</p>
    
                            <h4>4.4 Others</h4>   
                                <ol type="1">
                                    <li>These Terms represent the entire agreement between you and us concerning your use of our app and supersede any prior agreements.</li>
                                    <li>Some features may be governed by additional terms, which will become part of our agreement with you. For example, commercial use or specific content may be subject to separate terms.</li>
                                    <li>If any part of these Terms is unenforceable, it will be amended to be enforceable, and the remaining parts will still apply.</li>
